# Technical Debt and Refactor TODO

## Purpose

This document records known temporary implementations, compatibility paths, and
future refactor candidates for Action Sports Journal.

The goal is not to treat every item as urgent. The goal is to keep technical
debt visible so future Codex/GPT sessions do not mistake temporary structure
for final product architecture.

## Current Principle

Action Sports Journal is currently in the AI Analysis Product Completion phase.
The immediate product goal is:

```text
one real video upload
-> durable input secured
-> analysis starts server-side
-> result completes
-> result restores
-> rider understands the result
```

Do not start AI Coach, progression, or broad UI redesign work until this loop
feels stable.

## Priority Groups

### Now

1. Upload completion before Moment creation.
2. Upload state and analysis state separation.

### Later UX Stage

3. Moment Detail screen structure.
9. Push notification deep link.

### Calibration Stage

4. Analysis timing and quality observation data.
5. AI calibration system.

### Stabilization Cleanup

6. Legacy/fallback endpoint cleanup.
7. Thumbnail storage policy.

### Multi-user / Product Stage

8. Auth and user model.

### Long-term Stability

10. Background upload.

## TODO Items

### 1. Upload Completion Before Moment Creation

Problem:

The correct durable-analysis architecture is to create a remote Moment and
AnalysisJob only after the source video has been durably stored.

Why it matters:

If a Moment row exists before the actual source video upload completes, the app
can show an analysis state for a video that the server cannot analyze. This
creates stale queued rows and makes the product feel broken.

Current direction:

```text
app selects video
-> app shows local uploading state
-> server receives source video
-> server writes source video to temporary durable Storage
-> server creates Moment
-> server creates AnalysisJob
-> server starts Gemini analysis
```

Status:

Implemented as the preferred direction through a source-video-first endpoint.
Continue validating this as the default path before creating the next QA build.

Do not regress to:

```text
create Moment first
-> upload source video later
```

except for legacy/fallback paths.

### 2. Upload State and Analysis State Separation

Problem:

The old status model only had:

```text
queued / processing / completed / failed
```

That was not enough because uploading and analysis are different phases.

Decision:

Use app-facing status concepts:

```text
uploading
upload_failed
queued
processing
completed
failed
```

Meaning:

- `uploading`: source video is still being sent to the server. User should not
  close the app yet.
- `upload_failed`: source video did not reach durable input storage. Analysis
  did not start.
- `queued`: upload is complete and analysis has been accepted by the server.
- `processing`: AI analysis is running.
- `completed`: EvidenceResult is ready.
- `failed`: analysis failed after upload was accepted.

DB note:

The persisted Moment status can remain narrower while the app uses additional
UI states. Do not force DB schema changes unless the product needs these states
for cross-device history.

### 3. Moment Detail Screen Structure

Problem:

The Detail screen currently mixes modal and page behavior. The earlier
edge-swipe dismiss worked mechanically but felt unnatural because the screen
does not behave like a true iOS navigation route.

Decision:

Keep the current close/back button and deletion UX stable for now. Later,
evaluate whether Moment Detail should become a router-backed screen rather than
a modal-like overlay.

Future candidates:

- iOS route-style back gesture.
- Modal swipe-down dismiss if the Detail screen becomes a true sheet/modal.
- Better media-first header behavior.

Do not patch gestures repeatedly without first deciding the screen model.

### 4. Analysis Timing and Quality Observation Data

Problem:

AI analysis time and quality vary. The project needs evidence before tuning
infrastructure, prompts, validators, or copy.

Record for real videos:

- video length
- file size
- queued -> started duration
- started -> completed duration
- AI candidate
- observed facts summary
- rider-expected trick/context
- whether result felt trustworthy
- whether push arrived
- whether restore felt immediate

Use this data to distinguish:

- Storage upload bottleneck
- Gemini file processing bottleneck
- Gemini inference bottleneck
- Render/backend bottleneck
- app restore/polling UX bottleneck

### 5. AI Calibration System

Problem:

Toeside/heelside, Back Roll, Tantrum, Basic Air, grab, and invert judgments
should not be tuned from one surprising result.

Decision:

Use sample-based calibration. Do not make emotional one-off prompt edits.

Calibration references:

- `docs/EVIDENCE_POSTPROCESSING_CALIBRATION_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/WAKEBOARD_TRICK_TAXONOMY_REFERENCE.md`
- `docs/WAKEBOARD_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`

Rule:

Only repeated failure patterns across multiple real videos should become prompt,
schema, validator, or KnowledgeRule changes.

### 6. Legacy/Fallback Endpoint Cleanup

Current compatibility paths:

- `/api/moments`
- `/api/moments/:momentId/source-video`
- `/api/moments/:momentId/analyze-stored-video`
- direct multipart evidence upload fallback

Why they exist:

They supported earlier pipeline stages and provide fallback while the
source-video-first path is being validated.

Cleanup direction:

After the source-video-first path is proven stable, decide which endpoints are:

- retained for explicit retry/fallback
- made internal-only
- deprecated
- removed

Do not remove fallback until Build QA confirms uploads, restore, deletion,
push, and Storage cleanup are stable.

### 7. Thumbnail Storage Policy

Policy so far:

- Source video Storage is temporary durable analysis input, not permanent video
  archive storage.
- Local video URI is used for playback when available.
- If local video URI is unavailable, thumbnail plus analysis result is still a
  valid restored state.

Open decision:

Should thumbnails become cross-device preview assets with their own durable
storage policy?

Recommendation:

Treat thumbnail persistence separately from source video persistence. A
thumbnail is product presentation metadata; the source video is temporary AI
input unless the product later becomes a cloud video library.

### 8. Auth and User Model

Current state:

The app is personal/QA-oriented and effectively single-user. The backend uses a
default user pattern.

Future work:

- real user identity
- RLS and ownership rules
- device token ownership
- token cleanup
- account deletion implications
- multi-device data consistency

Do not overbuild this before the personal analysis loop is stable.

### 9. Push Deep Link

Current state:

Push notification opens the app.

Future work:

Push should eventually deep link to the completed Moment Detail:

```text
upload
-> app closed
-> analysis completed
-> push
-> tap
-> specific Moment Detail
```

Keep out of current scope unless the analysis loop is otherwise stable.

### 10. Background Upload

Current state:

The app tells the user not to close the app during source video upload.

Why:

Without OS-level background upload, the multipart request can be interrupted
when the app is killed or suspended.

Future option:

Investigate iOS background upload support if uploads become long or users
regularly close the app immediately.

Decision for now:

Use clear UX copy and source-video-first architecture. Background upload is a
long-term stability candidate, not the current MVP requirement.

## Current Do / Do Not

Do:

- keep source-video-first upload as the preferred path
- keep upload and analysis status distinct
- collect real timing and quality data
- preserve fallback paths until QA proves the new path

Do not:

- start AI Coach yet
- tune prompts from one clip
- treat Supabase Storage as permanent video library
- auto-clear QA data after every build
- hide architectural debt in chat only
